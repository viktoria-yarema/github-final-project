# Adding a Code of Conduct to Your GitHub Repository

A code of conduct helps set the ground rules for the behavior of your project's participants. It defines standards for how to engage in a community.

GitHub provides templates for common codes of conduct to help you quickly add one to your project. To add a code of conduct to your project, complete the following steps:

1. **Create a new repository (if needed):**
    - Go to GitHub.
    - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner.
    - Select "New repository."
    - Fill in the repository details and create it.

2. **Add a Code of Conduct:**
    - Go to your repository's homepage on GitHub.
    - Click on "Add file" and select "Create new file."
    - Name the file `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
    - In the file editor, add the "Contributor Covenant" template. You can find the template [here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md).
    - Click "Commit new file" to save it to your repository.

3. **Verify the File:**
    - Go to your repository's homepage.
    - Ensure that the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file is present in the root folder of the repository.

Following these steps will help you establish a clear code of conduct for your project's participants.
